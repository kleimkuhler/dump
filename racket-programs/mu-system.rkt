;; The MU puzzle is a puzzle stated by Douglas Hofstadter and found in GÃ¶del,
;; Escher, Bach. As stated, it is an example of a Post canonical system and can
;; be reformulated as a string rewriting system.

;; This puzzle caught my attention as a good way to think about this formal
;; system outside of the book and incorporate it into a program.

(define MU-puzzle
  ;; Initialize a string to '(M I) and dispatch string manipulation procedures
  (let ((str '(M I)))
    (define (xI->xIU)

          "Puzzle must end in I"))
